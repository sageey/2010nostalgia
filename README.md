  The idea of 'creative computing' makes me think of the digital 'aesthetic'. There’s just something about the monospace type sitting and juxtaposing against a dark background     that immediately sends me to a place of nostalgia. Coming into this project, I was initially worried about my outcome - how can I make something if I can’t even get the bulb     on the Arduino kit to light up? the only successful experience I had with coding was tragically inserting a pre-generated music bot into my Tumblr page's HTML when I was 14.     So, I decided to follow the route of learning the basics of HTML and site building. <a href="https://superhi-books.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-to-code-now.pdf"> I found this         reference to be the most useful in learning HTML. </a>

  I started researching ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) art, and how easily you can communicate visual ideas through code; this idea visually drew so    many parallels with ‘Habbo Hotel’, a JavaScript game I used to play, where users were able to create custom chatrooms, characters and create communities through them - this      game mastered a nostalgia-inducing style that other games cannot replicate, and most notably fed into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp2EZbbuMa0&t=14s&ab_channel=InternetHistorian"> meme culture. </a>

  I looked at artists who represented memoirs, or a feeling of lost time in digital art. I encountered the art of Daniel Rozin, an Israeli-American artist who specialises in       interactive digital art. His sculptures/installations predominantly react to the viewer, creating a blurry mirror image of the person in front of it. Because of its geometric   construction, resembling pixilation, the image withstands this feeling of anonymity, similarly to the use of making an avatar in video games. This made me consider how           through ASCII imagery, you can create this idea of ‘fake presence’, a loss or fleeting sense of time through nostalgia and memory of a digital age, a novel idea made only for   the new generation.

  I focused on replicating Habbo’s isometric style through digital drawing, a medium I am very familiar with. I logged into my old account on Habbo, and created a composition to   reference. I eventually ran my modified image through an ASCII generator, and played with colour and pixel scale settings to create an anonymous yet nostalgic feeling through    this imagery.

Overall, I learnt a lot about Creative Computing – Not only did I expand my knowledge on specific technical terms, but I also ignited an appreciation and enjoyment for coding, something that I would have pushed away from had I not been suggested to try it and I will continue to learn it. <3 Looking into these themes of nostalgia for the digital age has made me want to further develop this idea, as a one-week project has certainly not been long enough to stretch this idea to its fullest potential, and I would also love to experiment/play around with this style more.
